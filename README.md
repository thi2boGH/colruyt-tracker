## Description
The project aims to develop a tool for tracking and analyzing price evolution across various Colruyt stores in Belgium. This tool will enable users to monitor real-time inflation and identify the cheapest shop for specific products. The core functionality revolves around daily web scraping of the Colruyt website to gather product prices from all its shops, storing this data, and then analyzing it to reveal price trends and differences among shops.
